Background:

Market basket analysis of transactional data from a grocery store.


Data Collection:

Our market basket analysis will utilize the purchase data collected from one month of
operation at a real-world grocery store.

The dataset used here was adapted from the Groceries dataset in
the arules R package. For more information, see: Hahsler M, Hornik
K, Reutterer T. Implications of probabilistic data modeling for mining
association rules.


Attributes:

The data contains 9,835 transactions or about
327 transactions per day (roughly 30 transactions per hour in a 12-hour business day),
suggesting that the retailer is not particularly large, nor is it particularly small.

The typical grocery store offers a huge variety of items. There might be five brands of
milk, a dozen different types of laundry detergent, and three brands of coffee. Given
the moderate size of the retailer, we will assume that they are not terribly concerned
with finding rules that apply only to a specific brand of milk or detergent. With
this in mind, all brand names can be removed from the purchases. This reduces the
number of groceries to a more manageable 169 types, using broad categories such as
chicken, frozen meals, margarine, and soda.
