Background:

Each year, many people fall ill and sometimes even die from ingesting poisonous
wild mushrooms. Since many mushrooms are very similar to each other in
appearance, occasionally even experienced mushroom gatherers are poisoned.
Unlike the identification of harmful plants such as a poison oak or poison ivy,
there are no clear rules such as "leaves of three, let them be" to identify whether a
wild mushroom is poisonous or edible. Complicating matters, many traditional
rules, such as "poisonous mushrooms are brightly colored," provide dangerous
or misleading information. If simple, clear, and consistent rules were available to
identify poisonous mushrooms, they could save the lives of foragers.


Data Collection:

To identify rules for distinguishing poisonous mushrooms, we will utilize the
Mushroom dataset by Jeff Schlimmer of Carnegie Mellon University. The raw dataset
is available freely at the UCI Machine Learning Repository ( http://archive.ics.
uci.edu/ml ).



Data Set Information:

This data set includes descriptions of hypothetical samples corresponding to 23 species of gilled mushrooms in the Agaricus and Lepiota Family (pp. 500-525). Each species is identified as definitely edible, definitely poisonous, or of unknown edibility and not recommended. This latter class was combined with the
"definitely poisonous" group to make two classes: poisonous and nonpoisonous. The Guide clearly states that there is no simple rule for determining the edibility of a mushroom; no rule like ``leaflets three, let it be'' for Poisonous Oak and Ivy.
