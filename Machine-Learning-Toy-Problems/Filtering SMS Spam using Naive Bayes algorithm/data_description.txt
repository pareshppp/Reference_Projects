# Background

As the worldwide use of mobile phones has grown, a new avenue for electronic
junk mail has opened for disreputable marketers. These advertisers utilize Short
Message Service (SMS) text messages to target potential consumers with unwanted
advertising known as SMS spam. This type of spam is particularly troublesome
because, unlike e-mail spam, many cellular phone users pay a fee per SMS received.
Developing a classification algorithm that could filter SMS spam would provide a
useful tool for cellular phone providers.

Since Naive Bayes has been used successfully for e-mail spam filtering, it seems
likely that it could also be applied to SMS spam. However, relative to e-mail spam,
SMS spam poses additional challenges for automated filters. SMS messages are often
limited to 160 characters, reducing the amount of text that can be used to identify
whether a message is junk. The limit, combined with small mobile phone keyboards,
has led many to adopt a form of SMS shorthand lingo, which further blurs the line
between legitimate messages and spam. Let's see how a simple Naive Bayes classifier
handles these challenges.


# Data Collection

To develop the Naive Bayes classifier, we will use data adapted from the SMS Spam
Collection at http://www.dt.fee.unicamp.br/~tiago/smsspamcollection/ 

This dataset includes the text of SMS messages along with a label indicating
whether the message is unwanted. Junk messages are labeled spam, while
legitimate messages are labeled ham.
