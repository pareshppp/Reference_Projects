Background:

In the field of engineering, it is crucial to have accurate estimates of the performance
of building materials. These estimates are required in order to develop safety
guidelines governing the materials used in the construction of buildings, bridges,
and roadways.

Estimating the strength of concrete is a challenge of particular interest. Although it is
used in nearly every construction project, concrete performance varies greatly due to
a wide variety of ingredients that interact in complex ways. As a result, it is difficult
to accurately predict the strength of the final product. A model that could reliably
predict concrete strength given a listing of the composition of the input materials
could result in safer construction practices.



Collecting data:

For this analysis, we will utilize data on the compressive strength of concrete donated
to the UCI Machine Learning Data Repository ( http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml )
by I-Cheng Yeh. As he found success using neural networks to model these data, we
will attempt to replicate his work using a simple neural network model in R.


Description:

According to the website, the concrete dataset contains 1,030 examples of concrete
with eight features describing the components used in the mixture. These features
are thought to be related to the final compressive strength and they include the
amount (in kilograms per cubic meter) of cement, slag, ash, water, superplasticizer,
coarse aggregate, and fine aggregate used in the product in addition to the aging
time (measured in days).
