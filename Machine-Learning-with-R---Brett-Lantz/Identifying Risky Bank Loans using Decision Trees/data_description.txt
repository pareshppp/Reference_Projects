# Background

The global financial crisis of 2007-2008 highlighted the importance of transparency
and rigor in banking practices. As the availability of credit was limited, banks
tightened their lending systems and turned to machine learning to more accurately
identify risky loans.
Decision trees are widely used in the banking industry due to their high accuracy
and ability to formulate a statistical model in plain language. Since government
organizations in many countries carefully monitor lending practices, executives must
be able to explain why one applicant was rejected for a loan while the others were
approved. This information is also useful for customers hoping to determine why
their credit rating is unsatisfactory.
It is likely that automated credit scoring models are employed to instantly approve
credit applications on the telephone and web. In this section, we will develop a
simple credit approval model using C5.0 decision trees. We will also see how the
results of the model can be tuned to minimize errors that result in a financial loss for
the institution.


# Data Collection

The idea behind our credit model is to identify factors that are predictive of higher
risk of default. Therefore, we need to obtain data on a large number of past bank loans
and whether the loan went into default, as well as information on the applicant.

Data with these characteristics is available in a dataset donated to the UCI Machine
Learning Data Repository ( http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml ) by Hans Hofmann of
the University of Hamburg. The dataset contains information on loans obtained from
a credit agency in Germany.


# Description

The credit dataset includes 1,000 examples on loans, plus a set of numeric and
nominal features indicating the characteristics of the loan and the loan applicant.
A class variable indicates whether the loan went into default.
